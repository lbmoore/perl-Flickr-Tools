=head1 NAME

Flickr::Tools - Tools to assist using the Flickr API

=head1 VERSION

CPAN:        1.21
Development: 1.21_02

=head1 SYNOPSIS

This is the base class for the various Flickr::Tools, you will probably want
one of the subclasses, such as Flickr::Tools::Person.

  my $tool = Flickr::Tool->new({config_file => 'my/storable/config/file.st'});

  my $tool = Flickr::Tool->new({
                                consumer_key    => '1234567890abcdefedcba0987654321',
                                consumer_secret => '123beefcafe321',
                                token           => '12345678909876-acdbeef55321',
                                token_secret    => '1234cafe4123b',
                               });


=head1 DESCRIPTION


=head1 METHODS

=over

=item C<new>

Returns a new Tool

=item C<api>

Returns the Flickr::API object this tool is using.

=item C<clear_api>

removes the Flickr::API object this tool was using.

=item C<user>

Returns the Flickr user hashref for the Flickr::API 
object this tool is using.

=back

=head1 PUBLIC ATTRIBUTES

=over

=item C<access_token> a read only attribute.

Returns your oauth access token if it is there. You
will more commonly use C<token> below.

=item C<auth_uri> a read only attribute.

Returns the Flickr oauth api uri. The default is most
likely what youy want.


=item C<callback> a read only attribute.

Returns your callback url if there is one.


=item C<config_file> a read only attribute.

Returns the path of your storable format configuration file, if there is one.

=item C<consumer_key> a read only attribute.

Returns your consumer key, this is required to create a tool object.

=item C<consumer_secret> a read only attribute.

Returns your consumer secret, this is required to create a tool object.

=item C<local> a read/write attribute.

local is a hashref that the tool keeps, but doesn't use. It is there to
store you own items in a tool.

 $tool->local($hashref);

or

 my $local = $tool->local;

=item C<request_method> a read only attribute.

=item C<request_token> a read only attribute.

=item C<request_url> a read only attribute.

=item C<rest_uri> a read only attribute.

=item C<signature_method> a read only attribute.

=item C<token> a read only attribute.

=item C<token_secret> a read only attribute.

=item C<unicode> a read only attribute.

=item C<version> a read only attribute.
