Flickr-Tools to-dos and ideas for future developments.


As of 1.22:

Short term: 

* integrate closely with Flickr::API distribution
* Split out the Flickr::API::* classes and move to Flickr::API
* move codebase to Moo 
* Re-vivify Flickr::Tools
* more tests
  - look into Test::API
  - look into Test::RequiresInternet and/or Test::Internet
  - look into Test::Plan


Long Term: 

* Go through older To-Dos and either do or drop them.
* build in all of the flickr api, and, perhaps, automate building some of these
  with flickr.reflection.* methods.
* some examples



As of release 0.02:

- No new To-Dos added for this version.

As of release 0.01:

- Add the methods that are still lacking from the Flickr API to the 
  lower-level Flickr::API::* classes;

- Change the tests in order to use live data when there is an active 
  net connection and only use the Mock objects when there isn't one (?);
- Convert all the dates to something more homogeneous. Messing with 
  dates is never pretty and I am not really inclined to use something 
  like Date::Manip, which is overkill, but I must decide on a format 
  and translate every date into it;


- Flickr::Photo::is_favorite should probably check if you are authenticated 
  and if you are not give some indication to the effect that the request 
  makes no sense;
- In Flickr::Photo perm_comment and perm_add_meta should only work if we 
  are authenticated and the owner of the photo. Must check that;
- In Flickr::Photo notes and tags should be first-class objects and not
  just an array passed around;
- Flickr::Photo::secret should be a bit more inteligent and check wether 
  we should even have acccess to the photo's secret before trying to get it;
- Extend the Flickr::Photo::[next|previous]_photo_info methods to receive 
  an extra parameter that indicates the photoset in which we are looking 
  for the previous and next photos (optional, if not present look for it 
  on the photostream as it does now);
- Obvious methods to implement on Flickr::Photo:
  - photosets (I belong to)


- Obvious methods to implement on Flickr::Person:
  - photos (I own)
